# Signal Flow Graph Solver
## About
" A signal-flow graph(SFG), often called a Mason graph, is a specialized flow graph, a directed graph in which nodes represent system variables, and branches (edges, arcs, or arrows) represent functional connections between pairs of nodes.<br/>
SFG's are most commonly used to represent signal flow in a physical system and its controller(s), forming a cyber-physical system.<br/>
Among their other uses are the representation of signal flow in various electronic networks and amplifiers, digital filters, state variable filters and some other types of analog filters. "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-flow_graph)<br/>
