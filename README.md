# Signal Flow Graph Solver
## About
> A signal-flow graph(SFG), often called a Mason graph, is a specialized flow graph,
a directed graph in which nodes represent system variables, and branches (edges, arcs, or arrows) represent functional connections between pairs of nodes.
SFG's are most commonly used to represent signal flow in a physical system and its controller(s),<br/> forming a cyber-physical system.
Among their other uses are the representation of signal flow in various electronic networks and amplifiers, digital filters, state variable filters and some other types of analog filters. "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-flow_graph)<br/>
